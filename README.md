# dmINF583

I only completed the first two exercises of the homework; I have had some trouble handling the database, which left me with little time to take care of the rest.

To see the result of my code, one needs to refer to the `hadoop_commands.sh` file. After having opened the docker image, the environment will be set up and the code run if one just copies and paste each line one after the other. The comments in this file give an indication as to what the purpose of a command is for both exercises.
